		<h1>An homage to one of my most favorite games:</h1>
		<h2>League of Legends</h2>
		<p>League of Legends is a fast-paced, competitive online game that blends the speed and intensity of an RTS with <abbr title="Role Playing Game">RPG</abbr> elements. Two teams of powerful champions, each with a unique design and playstyle, battle head-to-head across multiple battlefields and game modes. With an ever-expanding roster of champions, frequent updates and a thriving tournament scene, League of Legends offers endless replayability for players of every skill level.
